# slidingpuzzle

This is a multi-sized grid puzzle and involves an AI to solve the grid.

$~$

**The Algorithm for AI**

A* search algorithm is implemented and the heuristic used is Manhattan distance. [More info here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#:~:text=A*%20is%20an%20informed%20search,shortest%20time%2C%20etc.)

$~$

**Limitation of the Algorithm**

The algorithm can only solve sized 2 and 3 grids quickly. Above that, it requires more time and demands space and processing power which, in my case, crashes web browser. 

$~$

**Solutions to the problem**
- [x] Use different heurestic.
  - Generally, increases the time to solve grids (Manhattan distance is the quickest) and still can't solve big-sized grids
- [ ] Implement a dynamic programming approach.
